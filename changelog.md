# Release 19.4.0

Main changes:

* **Underground Jungle** now requires the [Phantom Library](https://github.com/PhantomLoader/PhantomLoader).
* The version number now follows the convention `<minecraftMajor>.<minecraftMinor>.<modVersion>`. That means version `19.4.0` is the first version for Minecraft `1.19.4`.

Additions:

* Added `ru_ru` language

Fixes:

* Fixed the biome generating on the surface when TerraBlender is installed (for real this time... I hope)
