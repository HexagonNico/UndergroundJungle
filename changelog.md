# Release 20.3.0

Main changes:

* **Underground Jungle** now requires the [Phantom Library](https://github.com/PhantomLoader/PhantomLoader).
* The version number now follows the convention `<minecraftMajor>.<minecraftMinor>.<modVersion>`. That means version `20.3.0` is the first version for Minecraft `1.20.3`.

Additions:

* Added `ru_ru` language

Fixes:

* Fixed the biome generating on the surface when TerraBlender is installed (for real this time... I hope)
* Fixed crashes in versions past 1.20.2
